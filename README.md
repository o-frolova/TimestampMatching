# TimestampMatching
<p>
<b>Task:</b>
        There are two cameras, each filming the same scene. We make
        a prediction based on this scene (e.g. detect a human pose).
        To improve the robustness of the detection algorithm,
        we average the predictions from both cameras at each moment.
        The camera data is a pair (frame, timestamp), where the timestamp
        represents the moment when the frame was captured by the camera.
        The structure of the prediction does not matter here. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b>
        For each frame of camera1, we need to find the index of the
        corresponding frame received by camera2. The frame i from camera2
        corresponds to the frame j from camera1, if
        abs(timestamps[i] - timestamps[j]) is minimal for all i.
